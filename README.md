Titanic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Overview
This repository contains my today;s task of Data Cleaning & Preprocessing using the Titanic dataset. The goal was to prepare clean and processed data for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, scaling numerical columns, and addressing outliers.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset

Files Used:

Titanic-Dataset.csv (main file for cleaning and preprocessing)

Key Steps
1. Data Exploration
Loaded the dataset using pandas.

Explored data types, checked for null values, and reviewed basic statistics.

2. Handling Missing Values
Used mean/median imputation for numerical columns (like Age, Fare).

Demonstrated KNN imputer for advanced missing value treatment.

3. Encoding Categorical Features
Applied label encoding for binary/ordinal columns (e.g., Sex).

Used one-hot encoding for nominal columns (e.g., Embarked).

4. Feature Scaling
Normalized and standardized numerical features (Age, Fare) using MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler.

5. Outlier Detection & Treatment
Visualized outliers with boxplots.

Treated outliers in continuous columns (Age, Fare) using capping or removal.
